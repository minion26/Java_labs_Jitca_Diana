Persistence :space_invader:
Continue the application from lab 8, creating an object-oriented model and using JPA (Java Persistence API) in order to communicate with the relational database.

The main specifications of the application are:

    1. Create all entity classes and repositories. Implement properly the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
    
    2. Create a generic AbstractRepository using generics in order to simplify the creation of the repository classes. You may take a look at the CrudRepository interface from Spring Framework.
    
    3. Insert, using JPA, a large number of fake artists and albums in the database and log the execution time of your JPQL statements.
